# üåê Data Analyst Agent ‚Äì Web Scraping & QnA with LLM + DuckDB

A **FastAPI backend** for dynamically analyzing web content. This project scrapes web pages, builds vector embeddings for semantic search, and answers user questions using **OpenRouter LLMs**. It also generates visualizations for numeric data, returning all results in structured **JSON responses**, including base64-encoded images.

Perfect for researchers, analysts, and developers who need to **interact with web data intelligently**.
